        | Both myself and my husband have visited twice on spur of the moment, hoping to get a table and we have been very lucky and managed to get one. I would in future try to book it's only fair as it does get busy. The staff are always very polite,happy and do there upmost to make you feel welcome and give you the best service possible. The food and drinks are also of excellent quality. Thanks again x

        | A lazy sunday afternoon tea with my daughter. A belated birthday treat which was better than we'd imagined, it was lovely inside and uncluttered, beautifully decorated. The staff were wonderful and friendly, the food was very high quality. We choose all different sandwich fillings, all outstanding. The scones were light as a feather and the cakes Wow! After demolishing it all and drinking 2 pots of tea we left very happy with our little find. Highly recommended.

        | Went for breakfast for mums birthday, booked a table which I'd recommend. Lovely surroundings and food and staff, only recommendation would be for hotter toast and more well done, it was only just slightly toasted but that's it! Cake was fab we took some away too. Will try the afternoon tea for sure.

        | It's was my 1st visit yesterday to the Tea Rooms. It is very nice and I would highly recommend this place. It is well worth a visit but you do need to book a table. The cakes are to die for they are delicious.

        | Had a lovely afternoon tea on Thursday, sandwiches, scones and cakes were all lovely. I'm so glad this venue has re-opened. It has previously been an art gallery but it was closed for years and it is just a perfect beautiful location for afternoon tea

        | went yesterday for afternoon tea which was excellent. sandwiches were well filled and were made with lovely fresh bread. Had fruit scones which were delicious but seemed to have shrunk since the last time we visited but would definitely recommend the tea rooms and will certainly revisit.

        | It was our first visit to Whitmore Tea Rooms yesterday. It was busy but we did manage to get a table as the people who it was booked for weren't coming in till 3pm & as we went in just after 1 we had plenty of time to enjoy the food. I had a Salmon & cream cheese sandwich. My husband a Ham/mustard one & my son had some oatcakes with bacon & cheese. Afterwards we chose some cake to take home. We wereSpoilt for choice with so many different flavours. It was lovely will definitely be going again. & not too far away from home either.
