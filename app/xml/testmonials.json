        <content>We have been let down by whitmore tea rooms! We went in to pay for a christening party two weeks before the event only to be told there was now an additional Â£500 room hire charge which was never mentioned when we booked 2 months previously

We felt completely let down and left with a party of 50 people with nowhere to go!

The attitude was awful and they weren't helpful at all! Luckily for us longton rugby club were more than happy to cater for our christening party!</content>
